The AI Animated Video Generator is an advanced deep learning-based system that generates animated videos from text, images, or sketches. It utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Transformers, and Neural Rendering to produce lifelike animations with smooth transitions.

Features
✅ AI-driven Animation – Generates animated videos using ML & DL
✅ Text-to-Video – Converts text scripts into realistic animations
✅ Image-to-Video – Generates animations from sketches or images
✅ Deep Neural Rendering – Enhances animation smoothness and realism
✅ Custom Styles – Supports various animation styles (2D, 3D, anime, realistic)
✅ GPU Acceleration – Optimized for high-performance computation
